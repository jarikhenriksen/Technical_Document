        <h2>Introduction to python</h2>
        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
           Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, 
           offering much more structure and support for large programs 
           than shell scripts or batch files can offer. Python also 
           offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, 
           it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. 
           Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or 
           Java programs, for several reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
            <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
            <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>On a more personal note, python was the first language I learned and had no problem studying for the
            following reasons: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is very verbose, a beginner could read a script and have a good understanding of what it does;</li>
            <li>and there is so much information available, any questions I had always had an answer.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Print to console</h2>

            <p>In many cases, you will need to see the output of a program visually, whether to ensure a portion of
                code works, or to make sure your program is doing what it wants. This can be done with the print() function
            </p>

            <code>print('Hello World!')
                #Hello World!
            </code>

            <p>Although this is a very simple use of print(), one can still see how easy it is to use and impliment. 
                print() can output many data types, and even do math inside of it.
            </p>

            <code>print(4 + 2)
                #6
            </code>

            <p>print() is a very useful function indeed.</p>

        <header>
            <h2>String basics</h2>

            <p>A string is a group of ASCII characters, surrounded by quotation marks, 
                either single or double. If you choose to use single quotes to begin the string, 
                you must also use single quotes to close the string.
            </p>

            <code>'This is a valid string' #open and close with single quotes <br>
                'This is not a valid string" #open and close with different quotes
            </code>

            <p>Strings don't just have to be letters, they can be numbers as well. </p>

            <code>'42 76 100, this is all a string'</code>

            <p>Many different functions can be applied to strings. these functions go beyond the 
                scope of this document, but more information can be found at
