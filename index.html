        <h2>Introduction to python</h2>
        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
           Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, 
           offering much more structure and support for large programs 
           than shell scripts or batch files can offer. Python also 
           offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, 
           it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. 
           Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or 
           Java programs, for several reasons:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
            <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
            <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>On a more personal note, python was the first language I learned and had no problem studying for the
            following reasons: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is very verbose, a beginner could read a script and have a good understanding of what it does;</li>
            <li>and there is so much information available, any questions I had always had an answer.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Print to console</h2>

            <p>In many cases, you will need to see the output of a program visually, whether to ensure a portion of
                code works, or to make sure your program is doing what it wants. This can be done with the print() function
            </p>

            <code>print('Hello World!')
                #Hello World!
            </code>

            <p>Although this is a very simple use of print(), one can still see how easy it is to use and impliment. 
                print() can output many data types, and even do math inside of it.
            </p>

            <code>print(4 + 2)
                #6
            </code>

            <p>print() is a very useful function indeed.</p>

    <div class='main-section' id='String_basics'>
        <header>
            <h2>String basics</h2>

            <p>A string is a group of ASCII characters, surrounded by quotation marks, 
                either single or double. If you choose to use single quotes to begin the string, 
                you must also use single quotes to close the string.
            </p>

            <code>'This is a valid string' #open and close with single quotes <br><br>
                'This is not a valid string" #open and close with different quotes
            </code>

            <p>Strings don't just have to be letters, they can be numbers as well. </p>

            <code>'42 76 100, this is all a string'</code>

            <p>Many different functions can be applied to strings. these functions go beyond the 
                scope of this document, but more information can be found at

    <div class='main-section' id='Arithmatic'>
        <header>
            <h2>Arithmatic</h2>
            <p>Like many programming langues, arithmatic is a very important concept, python is 
                no exception. Some of the operators you will encounter in python are 
                + (addition) - (subtraction) * (multiplication) / (division) as well as the % (modulus), 
                which returns the remainder of two numbers when divided.
            </p>

            <code>5 % 10 = 0 #there is no remainder<br><br>
                5 % 11 = 1 #there is a remainder equivalent to 1
            </code>

            <p>All math operators can be done to variables as well, assuming those variables
                reference a number.
            </p>
            <code>
                a = 10 <br>
                b = 5 <br><br>
                c = a + b <br><br>
                print(c) #you will see 15 printed to the console
            </code>

    <div class='main-section' id='Lists'>
        <header>   
            <h2>Lists</h2>

            <p>information in python can be stored in a list, also called an array in other languages. 
                Many object types can be stored in a list, even other lists can be stored in a list!
            </p>

            <code>
                myList = [1, 2, 3, 'this string', 2nd string, ['another list!', 1, 2, 3]]
            </code>

            <p>A list is declared like any variable, only it must be opened and closed by 
                square brackets. Inside a valid list, each object is seperated by a comma, as seen above.<br>
                Many functions can be applied to a list, such as removing items, adding items,
                seeing how long the list as and more.</p>
        </header>
    </div>

    <div class='main-section' id='If...Else'>
        <header>
            <h2>If...Else</h2>
            <p>An if else statement is used when you want your program to work logically. 
                A human equivalent would be 'If it is raining, i need an umbrella, else I am ready to go without.'
            </p>

            <code>
                a = 4<br><br>
                if a > 10:<br>
                    print('more than 10')<br><br>
                
                else:<br>
                    print('less than 10')<br><br>

                #console will log 'less than 10', since a is equal to 4
            </code>

            <p>While this is a very simple example of if else, it is easy to see the applications.
                 They can run certain code if an argument is true or false, if an array contains a certain element,
                  and many, many more. More information can be found at <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp'>w3schools.</a>
